DiscordTickets is a Discord bot for managing support ticket channels, to allow you and your team to provide better and quicker assistance to your members/customers. It is a free, open-source, and self-hosted alternative to [Ticket Tool](https://tickettool.xyz/) and [TicketsBot](https://ticketsbot.net/) premium/whitelabel plans.

## Features

- Highly customisable
- Ticket "panel" / "widget" (react to embed to create ticket)
- Simple commands
- Supports multiple databases: SQLite (easy, default), MySQL (recommend) storage, MariaDB, PostgreSQL and Microsoft SQL Server
- Most (all of the best) features of the premium bots, for free
- Self-hosted with your bot application, your logo and guild name
- Optional express.js server for web archives: [DiscordTickets-Portal](https://github.com/eartharoid/DiscordTickets-Portal/)

Basic installation support will be provided on Discord, however if you really don't know what you're doing, you can purchase the [premium support setup service](https://ko-fi.com/s/34ccccfbd6) and I will install the bot and portal (archives web server) for you.
